## Description:
In this program, you get to play checkers! You can choose from a set of predetermined users to play as, and you can play against either another user or an AI created by us and test your might. Ideally, this program would also track player stats such as wins, losses, and number of turns per game in a database, and display a leaderboard based on wins in the fewest turns. However, there was an issue with database creation through AWS where the database can only be accessed from the machine that originally created the database. As a result, we have dropped this functionality of our program, but you are still able to play a fun game of checkers!
